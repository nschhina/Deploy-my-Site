	<blockquote>I'm a software engineering student enrolled at the University of Waterloo, in the Software Engineering co-op program.
	I'm in the class of 2022, and in the blog I will discuss my life experiences and about the difficulties a student may face starting his undergradute degree at the University of Waterloo. Being an international student I will also give the readers a perspective on the culture and traditions in Canada. I identify myself as an introvert therefore this is my attempt to step out of my comfort zone. I'm confident that my readers will get a deep sense of what student life in Canada really is. Without any further adieu let's have fun <strong>together!</strong></blockquote>

	<h2>Welcome to Canada</h2>
	<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	<br>
		<div id="intro">
	<blockquote> I had arrived in Canada about 20 days before the University begins. Being August the weather is really pleasant, Canadian summer is great and probably it is the best time to visit the country. Being here in Canada before, I feel familiar with the environment and culture. Things haven't changed much from the time I last visit three years ago. I've left everything behind- my home, family and most importantly my old lazy habits to start a new life altogether for a better future. I'll be brutally honest here, I'm not accustomed to doing everything by myself- cooking, washing and cleaning. It seems really overwhelming at the beginning but I chose this life, I have to struggle and I have to make myself fit. Hence this newly found independence is kind of bittersweet. It is a steep learning curve if you ask me but highly rewarding.
	<br>
	<br>
	Like I said before, it has been just 20 days but I already feel I'm much more mature and responsible now. Maybe it's just a new country thing but I'll give it some more time before I get to a verdict. O-Week is just 5 days away and I honestly can't wait. I'm excited and scared at the same time, excited because I will get to meet a lot of talented people at Waterloo and scared because I'm unsure about what to expect and what people expect of me. It's tricky to cope up with such diversity of people and their cultures/traditions. But I am here to fight, fight with my own self, my shortcomings to achieve newer heights. Who doesn't like that sweet taste of success right? 
	<br>
	<br>
	As I prepare to move in, I can't stop thinking of the stuff and people I've left behind. Things which were so important to me at one point of my life can no longer fit into my small dorm room. "You don't value stuff until it leaves you" cannot be more correct. The luxuries I had before at my disposal are no longer there and I gotta live this way for next 5 years. This task looks intimidating but like I said before I'm gonna fight and I'm all prepared.

	<h2>Orientation Week- Week full of fun?</h2>
	<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	<br>
		<div id="intro">
	<blockquote> Just two days after the move in- frosh week aka o-week began. After sleepless nights of ping pong I started orientation week already drained out- kinda bad move I guess?
	Well to get all this started I had to wait in the Watcard line for over 50 minutes and trust me it actually wasn't the rush period when I obtained my watcard. I have a suggestion for all my readers here- WAKE UP EARLY and reach watcard office before it actually opens! After all this hustle I had to check in for orientation in SLC(Student Life Centre) where I got my swag bag and a very packed schedule for the entire week. The swag bag included a toothbrush, a water bottle, minature hard hat, an agenda, sticky notes, phone watcard holder and a condom.
	<br>
	<br>
	Being in Software Engineering gives you the opportunity to participate in both Engineering and Math orientation events. Which obviously gives you no time to relax or sleep, especially if you are bad at time management like me. Day 1 was although pretty light with just "Warrior Welcome" taking place in the evening which is a pep talk by our beloved President and Feds leader. It was kind off emotional talk on how to basically struggle hard to get through and achieve your dreams. To my understanding University was heavily emphasizing on mental health probably because of a couple of tragic incidents in the past term.

	<br>
	<br>
	The next day it was all engineering orientation for us Software engineers to earn our coveted yellow hard hat. The theme for the 2017 engineeringorientation was "Beasts and Legends" and frosh was divided into several color groups- I got light orange. We had to meetup at our color's headquarter where we learnt some sick team chants and engineering anthem. Next we were walked to attend this presentation by EngSoc to get frosh familiar with "Engineering traditions". I would not talk more about the presentation here because I feel it should be kept a surprise for the future frosh. Then all eng. departments split up for their respective department lunch to get more familiar with their classmates and professors. Being in Software Engineering has it's own advantages- we were taken to a restaurant whereas all other departments had their lunch in some room in the school buildings. For me the department lunch was the highlight of the frosh week. It was fun to meet people with whom I'm going to spend the next 5 years of my life for the first time. Director and associate director of Soft Eng were present and I loved interacting with them and I did seek helpful tips, do's and don'ts from them. After this the most awaited moment had come- finally our chance to earn our hard hats. It was a day full of activites which again I would not talk much about.
	<br>
	<br>
	For the next day our schedule was full of math orientation activities. According to me the events for the math orientation were very cheesy and could've been skipped. All we did that day was a dance for which we got our pink tie. There honestly isn't much to talk about the math orientation and in fact I would recommend not attending it. I feel I'm being a little bit too harsh on it because we didn't get to attend "Junkyard Wars" which is an engineering orientation event that took place on the same day. The next two days we had our lectures, there wasn't much taught during these two days but just some briefing over the course outline and assignment submission guidelines.
	<br>
	<br>
	Given I was so tired of a sleepless week I decided to skip the events on the day following our classes. We had our semi formal dance on Saturday, I was totally hyped for this event because I totally love dressing up(I mean who doesn't!). Unfortunately I had removed my orientation wrist band and they had a strict rule of having the bands on for entry. Fortunately I somehow made it in, but pro-tip guys, don't ever remove your orientation wrist band at all during the frosh week! University set up this pseudo casino kind of thing inside PAC(No real money involved LOL).
	They also had a DJ in the SLC great hall to dance to and a lot of free food and drinks inside out. It was actually not that fun as I had expected but meeting other frosh during this event was totally worth it. 
	<br>
	<br>

	This brings me to the end of frosh week a memorable and once in a lifetime experience. University of Waterloo is not known for it's frosh week and I can't agree more but if you ask me if I would like to do this all over again, my answer will be yes. The people around you actually make the experience worthwhile and not the events. With a lowkey heavy heart I'm now entering the phase of rigourous academics after a short 6 month break ;) I will try to blog near midterm week now and update on my university academic experience.
